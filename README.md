# tensorflow-object-detection

this project is focus on object detection model from tensorflow using opencv for the model inference. 
In this state, I use mobilenet_v2 with COCO dataset from this link >> http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz

## How to use?
1. clone this project
2. install nessessary dependency modules for requirements.txt. I tested this project on Macbook air M1. So, please check importance dependency modules for your system.  
3. run python3 video_object_detection.py

## Next step?

As part of my learning I have plan to 
1. implement tensorflow training on the custom object which is not included this COCO dataset. 
2. YOLOv5 model inference from tensorflow model using opencv.
3. face detection model inference from tensorflow.
